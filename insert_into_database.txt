Now to populate the database (i.e., insert sample data into your Package and Booking tables), you have a few solid options depending on how you want to test it.

Let’s go through the easiest and cleanest ones 👇

🧩 1. Use the Django shell (recommended for manual testing)

After running:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


You can open the Django shell:

python manage.py shell


Then type:

from bookings.models import Package
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Create a user (or fetch an existing one)
user, _ = User.objects.get_or_create(username="nikhil", defaults={"email": "shubhayusadhak@gmail.com", "password": "test1234"})

# Add some sample packages
p1 = Package.objects.create(
    name="Goa Beach Retreat",
    destination="Goa",
    description="Enjoy sun, sand, and sea with our exclusive Goa package.",
    duration_days=5,
    price=14999.99
)

p4 = Package.objects.create(
    name="China Exploration",
    destination="China",
    description="Soak in the rich culture, cuisines and monuments of China",
    duration_days=10,
    price=30,000.00,
)

print("✅ Added Packages:", Package.objects.all())


If you want to test Booking too, make sure your guide app exists and at least one Guide entry is present; otherwise, leave it null:

from bookings.models import Booking

b1 = Booking.objects.create(
    package=p5,
    user="nikhil",
    full_name="Ravi Sharma",
    email="ravi@example.com",
    phone="9876543210",
    travel_date="2025-11-15",
    number_of_people=2,
    total_amount=29999.98
)

print("✅ Booking created:", b1)


Then exit the shell with:

exit()

⚙️ 2. Use Django admin interface (for GUI entry)

If you haven’t already, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser


Then run:

python manage.py runserver


Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
, log in, and you’ll see your Packages and Bookings models listed — you can add entries directly there.

(Make sure your models are registered in admin.py)

Example:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Package, Booking

admin.site.register(Package)
admin.site.register(Booking)

🧮 3. (Optional) Load a bulk dataset with fixtures

If you want to preload data automatically, you can create a JSON fixture like packages/fixtures/packages.json:

[
  {
    "model": "packages.package",
    "pk": "1",
    "fields": {
      "name": "Goa Beach Retreat",
      "destination": "Goa",
      "description": "Enjoy sun, sand, and sea with our exclusive Goa package.",
      "duration_days": 5,
      "price": "14999.99",
      "is_active": true
    }
  }
]


Then load it:

python manage.py loaddata packages/fixtures/packages.json
